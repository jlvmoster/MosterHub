# Project Management (PM) Best Practices

## Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM)

Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) is a project management methodology that addresses resource constraints and uncertainty in project scheduling by focusing on the critical chain, a sequence of tasks dependent on both logical and resource dependencies.

## The Iron Triangle (Triple Constraint)

The Project Management Iron Triangle refers to the triple constraint of **Scope, Time, and Cost** (with Quality often seen as an inherent outcome). It asserts that you cannot change one side of the triangle without affecting the others: for a given project, if scope increases, either timeline must extend or costs (resources) must increase; if you cut the budget, you must reduce scope or accept a longer schedule, and so on.

**Practical use:** In tech and agile projects, this principle is used to balance trade-offs. For instance, if a client wants to add new features (greater scope), the project manager will remind them that unless the deadline is moved or more developers are added, quality could suffer. Modern agile thinking sometimes reframes the triangle with Quality as fixed and negotiates scope or time, but the core idea remains: you can’t have it all. This “pick two of fast, cheap, good” concept is a guiding principle when setting project expectations and negotiating changes.
